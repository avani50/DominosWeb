                <p>In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, Jim, took over the operation of DomiNick's, an existing location of a small pizza restaurant chain that had been owned by Dominick DeVarti, at 507 Cross Street (now 301 West Cross Street) in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University. The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, then the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store. The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but Jim did not want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, Jim traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries. Customers could get their pizza hot at their doorstep, or they could pick it up themselves from the restaurant, which was only open from 5 p.m. to midnight each night in the early 1960s. Hours would eventually expand, and in 1965, Tom Monaghan renamed Dominick's, slightly, to Domino's.</p>
